Video game

Hello Everyone

I developed a pure javascript game and I wanted to share my work so that everyone can improve the code or test the game on your local host. Allow me to tell you how you can play at Simon X Challenge. 

Below are the steps you should follow:.

Step 1: Click the green button in the upper right-hand corner, which is called the code.

Step 2: If you have no Github Desktop account, then you can upload the zip file.

Step 3: Extract the zip file and pass it on the desktop.

Step 4: Avoid removing any files from the folder.

Step 5: Double click the index.html files.

Step 6: The file path will become part of the local servers and this means that your desktop or laptop will let you play the game.

Step 7: The link will only work on the browser named google chrome, then copy and paste it on the right browser.

Step 8: Click Space button to get the first answer and follow the model after the following beat.
